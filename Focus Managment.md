- **MITs (Most Important Tasks)**: Identify 2-3 key tasks to complete each day.  
- **Time Blocking**: Assign specific time slots for deep work, emails, and breaks.  

### **B. Reducing Distractions**
- **Digital Detox**: Turn off non-essential notifications.  
- **Pomodoro Technique**: Work for 25-50 minutes, then take a short break.  
- **Environment Optimization**: Work in a clutter-free, quiet space.  

### **C. Enhancing Concentration**

- Discuss the cost of poor focus (e.g., mistakes, stress, wasted time).  

### **Step 2: Teach One Technique at a Time**
- Start with a simple method like the **Pomodoro Technique** or **MITs**.  
- Have learners practice it and reflect on how it improved their focus.  

### **Step 3: Interactive Exercises**
- **Focus Challenge**: Ask them to work distraction-free for 25 minutes.  
- **Distraction Journal**: Have them track and reduce distractions over a week.  
- **Task Prioritization Exercise**: Give them a to-do list and have them apply the **Eisenhower Matrix**.  

### **Step 4: Reinforce with Tools & Resources**
- Use apps like **Forest, Freedom, or Focus Booster** for focus tracking.  
- Share videos, books, or articles on deep work (e.g., *Deep Work* by Cal Newport).  

### **Step 5: Monitor Progress & Adjust**
- Have follow-up discussions to check improvement.
